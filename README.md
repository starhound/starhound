# 👋 I'm Wesley Reid (Starhound)
### Senior Software Engineer | AI & Systems Architect | Infrastructure Specialist

I bridge the gap between complex legacy systems and modern enterprise cloud architecture. Currently, I lead the development of AI-driven integrations and mission-critical document distribution systems for the **Aviation and Regulatory** sectors. 

Beyond the enterprise, I am the long-term architect of **Lost Souls MUD**, a project that has served as my personal laboratory for high-concurrency systems and extreme-scale software engineering for almost a decade.

### 🌌 The Lost Souls MUD Pillar
Since 2018, I have served as the **Project Lead and Owner** of one of the internet’s longest-running and most technically complex virtual worlds.
* **Legacy Stewardship:** Managing a 35-year-old codebase (LPC/C) with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, refactoring legacy drivers, and modernizing the *Ain Soph* mudlib.
* **Complex Systems:** Architecting intricate engine features including A* search algorithms, limb-based physical modeling, and complex AI behaviors that predated modern LLMs.
* **Platform Engineering:** Operating a multi-node **Kubernetes** platform that handles real-time telemetry, monitoring, and web APIs for a global user base.
* **Team Leadership:** Directing a volunteer development team of over 10 international software professionals, enforcing documentation standards, and implementing modern CI/CD workflows for a historically "un-automatable" environment.

### 🚀 Enterprise Expertise
* **AI & NLP Orchestration:** Architecting LLM integrations and low-level NLP pipelines using **AWS Bedrock** and **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**.
* **Modern .NET & Java:** Expert-level development in **.NET 8+**, **Java (Spring/Hibernate)**, and **TypeScript** for high-compliance industries.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via **Terraform** and **Bicep** to manage Azure and AWS cloud environments.
